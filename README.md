# Edge-Node-AI-Embedded-surveillance-security-system
Description: Building an edge AI system that processes video from a security camera to detect and alert on suspicious activities.

Key Components:
Camera module for video input.
AI model for detecting specific activities or objects (e.g., motion detection, object detection).
Embedded system for real-time processing.

Benefits of using raspberry to process data on the edge:
Using edge node technology also reduces latency
Reduced Latency as data doesn't have to travel to and from the cloud/servers. 
Edge devices don't rely as much on network connectivity, so they recover faster in case of network failures. 
Edge devices is that they can operate independently, even in the absence of a network connection. This is particularly useful for applications that need to function in remote or isolated locations.

Materials: Raspberry Pi Camera Module V2-8 Megapixel,1080p (RPI-CAM-V2), 4K Micro HDMI to HDMI Male Cable Adapter, HC-SR501 PIR Infrared Sensor Human Body Infrared Motion Module for Arduino Raspberry Pi, Raspberry Pi 5 8GB RAM Broadcom BCM2712 Arm Cortex-A76 2.4GHz Quad-core 64-bit Single Board Computer 

Instructions to connect components:
1.) Flash the raspberry pi os for raspberry pi 5 onto a micro sd card then insert the microsd card the raspberry pi 5 board.
2.) Once the Raspberry Pi 5 is powered on, you can then start installing the software on the raspberry pi terminal following the installation scripts/instructions files in this repository
3.)
4.)
5.)
6.)
