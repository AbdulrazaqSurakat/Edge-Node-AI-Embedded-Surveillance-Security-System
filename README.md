# Edge-Node-AI-Embedded-surveillance-security-system
Description: Building an edge AI system that processes video from a security camera to detect and alert on suspicious activities.

Key Components:
Camera module for video input.
AI model for detecting specific activities or objects (e.g., motion detection, object detection).
Embedded system for real-time processing.

Benefits of using raspberry to process data on the edge:
Using edge node technology also reduces latency
Reduced Latency as data doesn't have to travel to and from the cloud/servers. 
Edge devices don't rely as much on network connectivity, so they recover faster in case of network failures. 
Edge devices is that they can operate independently, even in the absence of a network connection. This is particularly useful for applications that need to function in remote or isolated locations.
