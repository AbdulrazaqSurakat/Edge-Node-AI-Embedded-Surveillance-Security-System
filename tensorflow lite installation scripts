Use the same virtual Environment you used for opencv: This is the recommended approach to avoid conflicts with system packages. You can create a virtual environment and then install the package within that environment: # Install python3-venv if you haven't already
sudo apt-get install python3-venv
# Create a new virtual environment
python3 -m venv myenv

# Activate the virtual environment:
source myenv/bin/activate

Install tflite-runtime: Now that youâ€™re in the virtual environment, you can install tflite-runtime without issues: pip install tflite-runtime

Deactivate the Virtual Environment: Once you're done, you can deactivate the virtual environment:deactivate
