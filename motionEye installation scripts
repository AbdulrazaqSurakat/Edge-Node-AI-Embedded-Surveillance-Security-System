I tried using this command: sudo apt-get update sudo apt-get install python3-pip python3-dev libssl-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev libjpeg-dev 
libz-dev sudo pip3 install motioneye, but I got stuck with this error trying to install  motionEye, here is the chat gpt description
(externally-managed-environment, occurs because newer versions of Debian (including the version used in Raspberry Pi OS) have stricter 
management of system-wide Python installations. It prevents pip from installing system-wide packages to avoid breaking the system's Python 
setup.)To install motionEye, i had to setup and use a Use a Virtual Environment
STEPS:
Install Virtual Environment: First, make sure the python3-venv package is installed:: sudo apt-get install python3-venv

python3 -m venv ~/motioneye-venv: python3 -m venv ~/motioneye-venv

Activate the Virtual Environment: Once the virtual environment is created, activate it: source ~/motioneye-venv/bin/activate

Install MotionEye Inside the Virtual Environment: Now that the virtual environment is active, you can safely install MotionEye:pip install motioneye
